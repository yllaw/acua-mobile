      "question": "What are the adoption fees?",
      "answer": "The adoption fee for a dog or puppy is about $125 and for a cat or kitten about $115. That fee will be reduced by $50 for dogs and $40 for cats if the dog or cat was already sterilized before arriving at our animal care center. We do offer discounted adoption rates for animals that have been in our care for more than 10 days. The adoption fee includes initial vaccines, a microchip including national registration, spaying and neutering fees, and a complementary veterinary medical exam at participating veterinary offices. The Department also provides post-operative pain medication for animals that have been spayed or neutered. The cost for the pain medication is $10 and is included in the cost above. The adoption fee does not include the dog or cat license fee, which must be paid, but varies depending on the City or area you live (already on our website)"
